# Never log in to your servers again with Ansible

For this meeting, we will be covering Ansible: a powerful tool for automating
anything you need to do on a remote server. I will start out the meeting giving
a gentle introduction to Ansible for those who haven't used it before, and then
Ryan Prior will take over, and talk about security when using Ansible for
production.

The simplest way to use Ansible is to write what are called "playbooks", which
are collections of commands you want to run on a remote server or servers.
Although Ansible itself is written in python, the playbooks are written in
YAML, and run using Ansible's command line tools. I'll show some examples to
get everyone up to speed and comfortable before Ryan shows how to use Ansible
for the big time.

Ryan's been working a lot with
[Ansible at Conjur](https://www.conjur.org/integrations/ansible.html).
He's coming hot off a talk at
[DevOpsDays: Madison](https://www.devopsdays.org/events/2017-madison/program/ryan-prior/),
and has kindly agreed to tailor some material for our group.
